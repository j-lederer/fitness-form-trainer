Running the project locally this is what I did: 
Inside the folder, itâ€™s best to create and activate a virtual environment (python3 -m venv venv followed by source venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows). Next, install all Python dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt. Once the packages finish installing, start the Flask server by executing python3 app.py; the application will launch on http://localhost:5000, where you can open a browser and explore the site. (If you want automatic reloads and detailed error messages while developing, set the environment variable FLASK_ENV=development before running the last command.)
